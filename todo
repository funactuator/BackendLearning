1. create a server and attach callback on it for request event.
2. callback method would take req and response as its object. This is very conventional naming system
3. start listening through server, make server online (port number, host, callback for server start)
4. Note the callback method will only work when you hit the domain on browser after browser is online
5. try printing request and response object just to see what they are
6. how to send response to the browser using response object
7. req object -- two properties --> method(get, post), url --> /, /home, /about etc . url does not include domain name
8. res.setHeader(), req.write(), req.end()
9. setHeader tells data type to client which we will be sending --> plain, html, json etc
10. setHeader('content-type', 'text/html')
11. setHeader('content-type', 'text/plain')
12. setHeader('content-type', 'text/json')
13. write() it is used to send data back to client
14. res.write('simple text') --> check elements, how source looks like
15. res.write('html in strig format')
16. res.end() it is used to end the connection : I am assuming this.
